adobe-kuler-clone
(the pixy color theme designer)
=================

This color picker is an interpretation that is very similar to the Adobe Kuler Color selection process.
I have seen many requests over the past for 'anyone who has a color picker similar to Adobe Kuler'.

This is one.

I have not looked at their code. I do not know how they created theirs. I simply saw the end result and made this module. I'm sure if you looked at their code you'd find that it works completely differently.

This code was originally used as a color selection tool for a Three.js project, in order to color multiple shapes simulatenously, using colors that look good together.
