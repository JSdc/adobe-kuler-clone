adobe-kuler-clone
(the pixy color theme designer)
=================

I have seen many many requests over the past years for 'anyone who has a color picker similar to Adobe'.
I made one as soon as they released Kuler, because of how great I thought it was. I have not yet implemented it the final product (live site) that I was building, but at the same time I have not seen anyone else answer the question of 'is there anyone out there who can do this'.

I have not looked at their code. I do not know how they created theirs. I simply saw the end result and made this module.

I really have not worked on it or improved it ince I originally created it, so I'm hoping putting it online can bring that.

This color picker is an interpretation that is very similar to the Adobe Kuler Color selection process.
