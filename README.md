adobe-kuler-clone
(the pixy color theme designer)
=================

This color picker is an interpretation that is very similar to the Adobe Kuler Color selection process.
I have seen many requests over the past for 'anyone who has a color picker similar to Adobe Kuler'.

This is one.

I have not looked at their code. I do not know how they created theirs. I simply saw the end result and made this module. I'm sure if you looked at their code you'd find that it works completely differently.

FEATURES:

• Touch support enabled 

• Multiple Color Rules

with the use of tinyColor.js you can switch the output to any color type (HEX, RGB, HSL, etc).

• A very different "Monochromatic" color rule implementation than Kuler. On purpose. I didn't like how all their nodes bunch up on one spot on the hue wheel.

UPCOMING FEATURES:

• Color Theme Selection (hard coded, not a database like Adobe's)


This code was originally used as a color selection tool for a Three.js project, in order to color multiple shapes simulatenously, using colors that look good together.
